# Darkify
Darkify is an extension/userscript to darken webpages in which the dark mode isn't in place. It's useful when browsering internet at midnight as it can reduce the light of screen.

[^1]: "New tricks" is derived from the saying "You can't teach an old dog new tricks." It means you can use websites in the ways you are used to.

* Smoother transition.
* Automatically enable upon pages ready.
* Detect built-in dark mode provided by websites.
